# blobbybilb's task manager

A task manager for humans.

## Why?

There are a lot of "productivity apps" out there, many of which I've tried for some amount of time—ranging from the minimal (a simple to-do list like Apple Reminders), to the comprehensive (Notion, etc.), to the... interesting (for example, Pomodone). So why this? None of apps I tried seemed ideal, and I noticed some things about what kind of things I (and, I would guess, many others) want in a productivity app.

### Observations

1. Regardless of which app I'm using, some similarites emerge in how I use it. Tasks that I'm working on or will be working on soon
2. It takes time to dig around to find where I'm keeping track of a task. It would be better if I could just see everything relevant at once, while still being able to focus.
3. Distractions come up. Some idea comes up while focusing on something else (eg. make an app that does xyz). I want to note something down for later (eg. backed up pictures folder to USB—don't back it up again this evening). It would
4. Being distracted by having to figure out how my productivity app works is annoying and stupid. I want it to be predictable and consistent.

### Features

- UI (on desktop) shows almost everything at once, but keeps different areas separated. (2)
- UI is split into relevant areas (1)
  - "Tasks" for current tasks - the most often used and the largest area
  - "Reminders" for things that you want to be reminded about at a specific time
  - "Later" for tasks to be dealt with later
  - "Scratchpad" for those things that come up in the middle (3)
  - Tabs for "Ideas" (for ideas for stuff that you may want to work on later) and "Long-term" (for long-term goals and tasks)
- Everything is just a simple text field, and works exactly like a normal text field works (4)
- The app formats each field (similarly, but optimised for what it's used for) to make it consistent
